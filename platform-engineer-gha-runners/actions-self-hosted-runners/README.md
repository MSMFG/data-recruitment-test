# Candidate brief 

In the data team at MSMG, we use GitHub actions and self-hosted runners on GKE. 
This is so that we can communicate with services inside our VPC from the CI/CD pipelines. 
An engineer is having trouble getting his pipeline to work and has asked you for help. 
Find and fix the bugs with the runners. 
An in-depth knowledge of Github actions self-hosted runners is not required. 

The terraform used to deploy the runners is located TODO 

The repo the engineer is trying to get his CICD pipeline working is TODO
