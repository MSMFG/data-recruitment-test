The purpose of this challenge is for the candidate to show off some of their python skill set. 
This particular challenge allows for a lot of freedom to show how well you know the features of the python standard library in a pythonic and performant way.

Callouts:
- The use of type annotations allows the IDE to show a user an object's properties/methods when writing the code and also pick up bugs before the code runs. see `mypy` for enforcement of static type checking
- Separating the concerns of input / splitting logic / output allows for reuse, extension, maintainability and easy testing for each individual concern
- There are a few quirky python features that I used in this solution that you may be interested in looking into: context managers, generator functions, class properties

Expectations:
- Junior: able to write a working script for either max_bytes or max_lines. write at least one unit test for any function to demonstrate knowledge.
- Mid: working script for both max_bytes and max_lines. thought given to / some degree of separated concerns. some tests 
- Senior+: similar to this solution in terms of code structure. >80% test coverage
